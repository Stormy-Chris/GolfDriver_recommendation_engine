    "### The ability to search for items has increased exponentially due to the internet. A recommendation engine is a way of reducing the inherent difficulty such searches provide by giving a more focussed output based on specific inputs, rather than having to wade through the multitude of search reults.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The system built for this project is a prototype to show that the task was possible. The user can choose to input a set of criteria for the drivers that they are searching for, including the brand, handedness, price, loft, shaft type and flex and any other keywords relevant to their search. This user input is requested and then used to provide a recommendation of the top ten matches for a golf driver. It is an unsupervised task as there are no user ratings provided with which to determine the accuracy of the recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The system can be improved in many ways by adding more websites from which options for drivers are increased and also getting more reviews. The data input method can also be refined to focus the users requirements. For example searching on the features selected (brand/model/dexterity/loft/shaft) to reduce the number of options before using the review and verdict fields to look for specific keyword matches. In fact the addition of the review and verdict fields seems to have actually made the recommender worse as there are too many words to compare with and the reviews all contain similar wording. Fixing this will be the focus of future work."

    "## *Brief Literature Review*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due to the nature of the user inputs the system was built using the FuzzyWuzzy python string matching function. This utilised the ability of function to the take any number of input values and compare them against the known values stored. This literature review will look at several other recommendation systems that use this technique and discuss the relative merits of this methodology. No other specifc golf driver recommendation systems were found, however, such systems exist on most golf retailer sites already where suggestions are made based on what other people have bought for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the discussion of their implementation of a movie recommender system Manis (2020) discuss the advantages of using the fuzzywuzzy by allowing for the mistyping of input, the string match is still able to find similar movies. They use the example of typing 'avengrs' for a recommendation for the movie 'Avengers'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### A global citation recommendation system was developed by Ayala-Gomez (2018) in which they discuss using the fuzzywuzzy package to merge 2 datasets based on the titles of the papers.  Their task is similar to this one in that they aimed 'to find papers that are relevant to a short description (abstract) of a new paper, provided as input.' The advantages of using the fuzzywuzzy package for this task are stated as allowing for different string matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The advantages of using the fuzzywuzzy package are also discussed by Dobin(2020) Given that the data dictionary was not clean, often times there was data match errors between our user data and the dictionary while meant that we had to implement fuzzy matching for the titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Based on these few reviews the implentation of a recommender system using the fuzzywuzzy package was a appropriate methodology for this task.\n"

    "### Nowadays almost any retail website you visit will provide you with a selection or recommendation of what products or services similar users purchased or liked - think Amazon or Ebay for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The rationale behind this project was to attempt to do something similar but not on such a large scale. Essentially a person who is interested in buying a new golf driver for themselves can be bombarded with information. Depending on their level of knowledge they may need some help when deciding which one to buy. This is the role this recommender system will fill. Data was scraped from a retail website of golf driver listings and of reviews from a golf magazine site. These two sets of data were then joined for use within the recommendation engine. The advantages to the implementation of this system using the fuzzywuzzy package was discussed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### As mentioned above there were two dataframes saved as csv files from Task 2. The first requirement was to now join those two dataframes based on the Driver_Name field stored in both. It was hoped that with 220 reviews that almost all of the 98 drivers for sale would have a matching review. This matching was done using the fuzzy_panda package using the Levenshtein distance method to calculate similarities, in this case between the similarities of the driver name in both dataframes. A visual inspection is provided to show the accuracy in joining driver with review. It was not perfect but acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The inputs were simply entered as a string. This is where I believe more work could be done to get the data entry side more robust. A web page with drop down menus and maybe a text box for entering a description would best suit this system. With the outputs displayed as a table with the name, link to buy, price, dexterity, flex, condition and sim_score given.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The natural language processing toolkit was used to tokenize, lemmatize and stem both the inputs and the reviews as well as removing the stop words. "

    "## *Performance*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessing the performance of this recommendation system was not able to be performed using the usual traing/test set methods. A simple explanation of the search results given is provided in the results section where several test runs were done and the output examined. Overall there needs to be some improvement with regards to the data entry method that would allow for better filtering of the choices (i.e. dexterity/flex type/condition etc.) before using the review and verdict fields for keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To test the performance of the recommender based solely on the specifications and not the review or verdict I ran a comparison by implementing a recommender without them. These results proved much closer to the user input values if specifications were entered. If however the query does not include the specification but is something like 'best driver toe player with high handicap' then include the review in the recommender does actually add a lot of value. \n",
    "\n",
    "### So there is a question that needs to be asked here. Who will the end users be. Will they be knowledgeable people or those just learning ?? Perhaps there could be two systems one for each type of user."
