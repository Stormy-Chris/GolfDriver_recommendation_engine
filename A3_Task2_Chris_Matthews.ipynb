These could then be linked together with the final aim to provide a recommendation for the end user of the system. After much research the sites listed above were chosen as they provided multiple drivers and reviews. \n",

    "### Using a trading site for the golf drivers allowed a mix of both new and older drivers to be found. The beauty of this is that typically only the latest or newest drivers are available on a specific golf retailers website. This would make having enough cases and variation hard to achieve. \n",

    "## Part 1 - Extracting the drivers for sale information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clicking on the golftraders link above will show the layout of the page from which the data was to be extracted. In general it consisted of a picture of a driver for sale with the price and some general details. The name of the driver that was displayed was also a link which took the viewer to another page where the specifics and further description of the driver were given. Only the driver name, the link to its' sale page and the price were extracted from the initial page. These were then supplemented by using the specifications given on the linked sale page. This supplemented information became important as it had the details that a buyer would be interested in. Namely the specific brand and model, whether the club was left or right handed, the loft of the driver, the shaft type and flex, the grip and the condition (new or used).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The process to extract then became a two step problem. Firstly the driver name, link to the individual driver page and the price were collected and stored. Then the link to each individual driver was followed to and the specific information extracted. This extra information was then also stored enhancing the information for each driver. The original driver name extracting with the link included extra information and was quite messy. By using the specific brand and model fields extracted in the enhancement step above it was possible to join these names and then use the joined name field to replace the driver name. This will help in the joining stage with the reviews, shown in the next webcrawler section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The layout of the golftraders website was rather complicated. Several attempts were required to get the coding right to extract the correct information. There were multiple drop down menus and filtering options available on the page that could be ignored. With the final extraction being the information listed in a set of heading tags and the price being stored in a span tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There was a copyright notice on the page. There were no issues using the site and no contact was made with the sites owners (either me contacted them or they contacting me. The terms of use page https://www.golftraders.com.au/terms_of_use  does not mention anything in regard to web scraping activities. So there were seemingly no legal impediments to using the site for this project.\n",

It was a golf magazine so there were some adverts, links to recent golf stories, video tips and podcasts on the front page.

So there were several steps involved in navigating and retrieving the reviews. The first step was to loop through all 12 pages and get the links to the 20 reviews from each page. Once these links were attained they could then each be visited and the relevant information extracted, namely the review and verdict fields, that were combined with the driver name field extracted from the link. While there was a price field it was in pounds and deemed of little value so not extracted.\n",
